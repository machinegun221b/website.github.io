The voice that Moses heard came from a burning bush. This voice is believed to be the same voice that Abraham heard, commanding him to leave Mespotamia based on the differences of Poly and Monotheism, to offer up his son as a sacrifice to God and the voice that told him to stop. The same voice that commanded Jacob to change his name to Israel. The voice that made Abraham do things he did not want to do. The voice that gave him the strength.


The same voice. Moses heard for the first time. Through a burning thorn-bush. The voice told him to do things that he was shit-your-pants-scared to do. He was running away. Afraid of what they might do to him, now that he’d killed someone, buried them and run away.


Incredulous he asked back, “who are you? What’s your name?” to which the voice’s reply was “I AM.” 


Not only was Moses in danger from the Pharoahs, he’d been given this insurmountable task of convincing the Israelites that the One True God had spoked to him and had commanded him to lead all the Israelites out of Egypt, to Freedom!
