After 6 years of life as a monk, Siddhartha Gauthama grew frustrated that neither meditation nor the intense renunciation that he was told would help get him closer to enlightenment had even remotely worked. So he announced he’d stop the renunciation that had brought him so close to death, and continued on his path alone. 


He found himself resting under a wild fig tree and decided then, to not move until he attained enlightenment. After 7 days, he realized, the desire to relieve himself of desire was what held him back. That night came to be known as the Sacred Night because that realization gave him the insight to grow to his highest form and hence cease the wheel of rebirth for himself. And with that Buddha, the Enlightened One was born. No more of what he had been thus far.


He went in search of the Monks he’d parted ways with to share with them what he’d learned. Upon finding them, he told them the way to put an end to the wheel is through the Middle Path - a path of moderation between extremes.
