I wrote something that I did not post. Will post when everything’s in place and ready. So you’ll see a gap in the dates. But once I post it, it’ll make sense. Like it’ll fall into place of the date/chronology stuff. Anyway, moving on!


Today’s post isn’t gonna be much. Not a lot of content. Just a piece for myself again I suppose. 


I went to the ISL match last night, tried not to scream. Because voice - damage, did not succeed. Went to Toit after a very long time. If anybody knows a REALLY GOOD pizza place, please let me know. Yesterday was kinda like reliving a night from back in 2020. Before COVID hit, and everything just like CHANGED. It was fun, but yeah I did end up blowing my entire budget for the month within about 6 hours. So, very fun.




Will continue the history of religion stuff again tomorrow. For now, 
Ciao!




P.S: Who got the TM  joke?
