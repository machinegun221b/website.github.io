Moses got the Israelites to agree they’d follow him if he could get the Pharoah to release them. They groaned but they agreed. 


Moses now had to convince the Pharoah. He first tried by asking for a few days off for the Israelites to go worship their God in the desert. Permission, of course, was denied. Then came the long, gruelling days.


Basically, Moses put together a crusade where the Egyptians were struck by one disaster after another by the Israelite God. Until finally, the Egyptians came to experience what the Israelites had a few decades earlier. 


The voice spoke again. Moses told the Israelites to sacrifice a lamb and mark their doors with its blood and stay in. And the next day the Egyptians woke up to the horror of finding their firstborns dead, as well as the firstborns of their cattle.


Following this, the Pharoah called Moses to tell him he’d won. They could go visit their God, giving the Egyptians a few days to mourn their dead.
