There’s been an interesting question in my mind the past couple of years: Are our faculties or our biology the hurdles between us and complete access to the universe? Does our biology not permit us to ever completely understand the universe?

But a thought I had the other day gave me a fresh new perspective. Let’s take a look.

Math attempts to explain the universe. The patterns that makeup the universe, the patterns it entails. It tries to describe every bit of the universe that’s ever existed or ever will exist.

At the same time our brains are able to make sense of these patterns and actually understand that math, which points to our biological ability to understand math. It’s intrinsic to the structure of our brain, our biology.

But by learning a way to interpret the universe through math did we discover something that already existed in nature, or did we make it all up? Most would argue that we discovered it, like every theory that we come up with in Physics to explain the universe, the math we discover are merely theories that help make sense of the universe and help us understand and look deeper into it. We cannot invent math. It is intrinsic to the universe.

And so, it seems we not only have this intrinsic ability to understand math but it also seems that this same math is what is intrinsic to the structure of the universe. And so here is the obvious fact that I’ve overlooked in thinking our biological chemistry, might be holding us back, which it is or might be in certain ways but with this new perspective, it seems, that our brains being of the same patterns as that of the universe is what makes us understand math or universe to begin with. The math of the cosmos and the quantum, the math of our biology. That is the theory that we refer to as a unified theory, the theory that we’ve been on the search for.

Our brains are able to understand and comprehend the universe because there is some match in wavelength. Which means there’s some pattern that intersects. And that has been the case, seemingly, only with our species, which means it could be a very particular pattern that may as well be difficult to replicate in biological organisms. Even though it’s the same math that makes up our natural world, makes up our brains as well, it remains to be the case of only a single species. Our brains naturally have the ability to interpret math.

So here’s the new question that arises now: what is this intersection point for all of it, then? Can that intersection point be the entirety of Math? If so, can we ever be sure?

Let’s discuss the hurdles our biology might be the cause of another time.
