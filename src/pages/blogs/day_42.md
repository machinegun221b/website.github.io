The Middle Path meant avoiding a life of pleasure and a life of self-torture. And the guides to the Middle Path are known as the Four Noble Truths: (paraphrasing here)

-   Suffering is universal

-   Desire is the root of suffering

-   Ending desire is the way to end suffering

-   The Eightfold Path, which is how to eliminate desire and thus suffering

And the Eightfold Path is as follows:

-   Right understanding 

-   Right thought 

-   Right speech 

-   Right action

-   Right livelihood

-   Right effort 

-   Right mindfulness

-   Right concentration

Right understanding and right thought are finding your way to the Middle Path and keeping with it. Right speech is to never slander or use harsh language. Right action refers to not stealing, killing or doing anything horrid or shameful. Right livelihood would be avoiding occupations that cause others harm.

The monks were convinced the Middle Path was the answer and became the Buddha's followers. And hence the Buddhist Sangha was born.

Buddhism isn't a faith. "It is something to practice rather than something to believe" - Richard Holloway.
