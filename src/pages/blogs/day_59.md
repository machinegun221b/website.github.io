Privilege seems convoluted to me. If you have it, you’re not supposed to hate it. If you don’t have it, craving it won’t make a difference. Your actions, sure can create a difference. But at the end of the day, it’ll still either get to your head or mess it up.
There doesn’t seem like there’s a third option. Or is there? Do you feel like there is? Tell me, please.


You require privilege. To do certain things you need it. For someone like me, even the most basic rights like freedom feel like privilege a lot of the time. I’m not gonna talk on behalf of a community like women, or others. 


What do you do when you have privilege that you can’t really use? Privilege that you can’t make much of? You have things that most people out there don’t. What do you do if you come from privilege but there’s no ground?


Like everything else, Privilege isn’t black and white. If anything Privilege is probably one of the grayest things out there. It sits right there alongside so many other things that make our heads spin, making us want to rip our heads off our necks. I’ve been told in other contexts that my writing can be a bit too graphic. I’m not sure. It depends on the reader is what I think, sometimes. But isn’t writing supposed to be graphic?


What is a privilege to you, might be a basic right for someone else. What is a basic right to you, might be out of reach in this lifetime for another human.


Of course, what I’m talking about here can be misconstrued. People living in poverty - that’s black and white. I’m not talking in relation to that. I’m talking in relation to the average person who might come across this piece of writing. I’m talking in relation to people who come from various backgrounds and then get stuck in the maze. 


There is a level I think. Until which “you have no choice”. That is the line until which Privilege is black and white. But beyond that, we’re all in the gray.
