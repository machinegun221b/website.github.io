Antiochus tried to enforce his Greek religion on the Israelites and pushed them to make sacrifices to his God Zeus. And along the way came Mattathias in a village called Modin just outside of Jerusalem. 


He launched into a rebellion by killing the enforcer instead of his sacrificial lamb. Along with his sons, he won 3 battles against the ruler and recaptured their temple after 3 long years. 


The 8 days it took to restore and cleanse their Temple is now observed as Hanukkah or the Festival of Lights.
