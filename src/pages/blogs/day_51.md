The Abrahamic religions Judaism, Christianity and Islam are all rooted here. Abraham’s son Isaac, Isaac’s son Jacob who later changed his name to Israel making all his 12 sons the children of Israel or “Israelites”, and Abraham’s other son Ishmael are all important characters in shaping these religions. All of which maintain Abraham to be their forefather.
