Since I’ve been writing so much about religion lately, as in the history of it and reading about a possible future, it’s kinda gotten me thinking about what happens in the minds of believers. I mean, when I read about some of the stories or the ideology, while there are things that make so much sense and seem so enlightened and philosophical in some instances, there are these other notions that are just so difficult for me to accept. 


It got me thinking, what might it be like to have completely accepted all the religious theories and then be thinking through that very lens. To only be able to look at the world around and our ownselves, through only that lens. 


If you’ve been regularly readin here, you might have seen that I’ve just finished unpacking a bit of the Hindu religion along with Buddhism and Jainism. The key point in all them being the cycle of rebirth and the idea of Karma. Also, how moksha or nirvana is the ultimate purpose or the journey we’re on to reach. 


So what strikes me here is, all of us alive right now are obviously so sinful or our karma has been in a way that has brought us to here, to this day. And what that means is that we must have all done something pretty bad, ‘cause it’s been a while. Our souls must be super old. And we never seem to have learned much. I mean, given the wars and whatnot that we keep doing. 


So that’s one thing. Another thing is, what would happen if all of us, collectively just stopped having kids. No new generation. Our souls can take any form, yes. But doesn’t that mean we’d just be born as another animal or a plant or a prokaryote? If all of them ceased to exist, our souls would just get stuck I suppose? Is that why we have such a deep-seated biological need to reproduce? Could that be a supposition made somewhere in our religious texts?


What do you think?
