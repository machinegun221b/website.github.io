So Moses died when they got closer to the Promised Land when he went up a mountain to take look at it.
The Israelites reached the Promised Land but they never had it easy. Having to fight every step of the way, to take hold and then to keep that hold. And then of course were the infights.


As we discussed before, the Jews have had it rough.
And that suffering led their belief to evolve. When stuck in Babylon on their next bout of slavery and imprisonment, they embraced the new idea, that God wasnâ€™t stuck in one place like just a temple they built for Him. God was everywhere. All around.
They finally understood what the Prophets had been talking about all along.
