I don’t feel like writing today. About anything at all. Don’t wanna use my brain to carry out this particular task, especially. 


There’s temple nearby, and there’s also a church. I don’t get it. The temple people just blast their speakers. It feels like it’s 24/7. I don’t understand why they need to disturb everyone in a 5km radius to feel closer to God.


Isn’t God supposed to be omnipresent? Isn’t God supposed to reside in you? In your hearts?


It’s like a lot of SDE. Somehow feel superior by fucking with the silence. Cuase the traffic alone isn’t cutting it anymore here in Bengaluru, is it now?


The traffic’s too peaceful and doesn’t make us all riled up. I mean, what is road rage? What aer traffic jams?


My God I can not listen to these people anymore.


Cwools. I’mma write properly again starting tomorrow. 
Peace out. A town.
