While wandering through the desert which felt never-ending to the people following Moses. Finally, they came to the foot of a mountain. Moses decided to go up the mountain, alone, in order to get the next set of instructions from God.


The people were worn out waiting for him to get back and decided to engage themselves in a religious celebration. They made an enormous golden bullcalf, like the one theyâ€™d seen the Egyptians worship. Moses was furious to see all this when he got back. And he called for silence. 


He said God had sent him with the Ten Commandments:
1. You shall have no other God before me.
2. Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven images. 
3. Thou shalt not take the name of the Lord thy God in vain.
4. Remember the Sabbath day and keep it Holy.
5. Honor your father and mother.
6. Thou shalt not kill.
7. Thou shalt not commit adultery. 
8. Thou shalt not steal.
9. Thou shall not bear false witness.
10. You shall not covet.
