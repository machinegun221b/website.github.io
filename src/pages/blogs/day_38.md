How many people here watch Succession? And how many thought, when they watched the season 3 finale, that THAT was the end? I mean, season 4 is coming in March and as happy as I am that there’s gonna be a season 4, I’m just so confused. Yes, the season 3 finale wouldn’t have been the best ending to the show, but it still might have created a kinda nice scenario where none of the family got anything. Coulda been nice you know. 


But then again, that is a pretty great backdrop for season 4. I mean, it’d be really cool to see what they might do. Also, can they just do something to Tom? Please? 


In other news, Samsung is pretty scary family, but then again, which Asian family isn’t? 


P.S: Can’t wait for March 4th to finally get here! Also unpopular opinion: liked the old art better than the new art.
