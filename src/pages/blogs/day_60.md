I saw this article that said that yesterday’s episode of AoT humanizes Eren with a particularly dark scene. Which is darker? The scene itself, or seeing a glimpse of yourself in Eren in that scene?


There is nothing that can save you. You’ll burn alive, be trampled to death. You will scurry away. But no matter what you do, you’re only getting closer to death.


The only thing that might come to help you right now? Mikasa? Armin? Levi? Hange? Annie? Anybody? Or is it time to accept that no one can do anything?


The terror. The screams are so much more comforting than the silence.


They’re an empathetic bunch. It’s not everyday you find truly empathetic people.


Such a beautifully made production. The epilogue. Everything. The attention to detail, the pace. Quality work, man. 





Hange, love you the most.
