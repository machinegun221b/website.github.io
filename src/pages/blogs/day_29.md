Religion is such a huge topic that is so closely interwoven with all of our lives. And yet it goes without mention in any orderly way of thought. We know so little about religion itself. I mean think about it. So much of what we think we know about religion, is just the various traditions that we’ve come to perform millennia later. We don’t really know the “important” stuff.


We don’t know how it began, what happened when this stuff started, how its impact has lasted for so long! We don’t learn much from it either, other than everything that seems to be man made.


When the idea of religion came into being, it was about spiritual awakening, learning of our creator and getting closer to that said creator. It was about discovering the universe beyond us. Or understanding what lie within. Its conception was a way out of misery and sorrow, and pain. It was about hope and love.


But that same religion, is what we’ve been using to create ruckus. We’ve created chaos and blamed it on things we cannot conceive. Violence is justified in the animal world. In a way, of all the living beings on this planet, animals are the only ones capable of that kind of violence.


Were humans meant to be better?
What was spirituality supposed to bring to that equation?


These are questions, that yet again, only we can answer, i.e., the human mind.
Violence is instinctive, it’s primal, it’s an evolutionary advantage. But why do we justify it in all the ways that we do?


All the fear that we have, why have we funnelled it through, in the most abstract mode perhaps?




Just opinions…
