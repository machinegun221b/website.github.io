This got me thinking. Since the Enlightenment Era, we humans might’ve gotten a bit cocky, especially toward the end of the Enlightenment era. Thinking that when we learn of everything that we are curious about, when we see with our own eyes and completely comprehend the conception of the universe and life itself, and come face to face with whether or not “Reality exists in the human mind and nowhere else” that we will be done. Our thirst will be quenched. But that last line: “or perhaps he knows not” - that even The One Thing may not know it all, puts everything into perspective. 


It’s like how Cardi-B says she was happier when she didn’t have the fame and success she gained, or like so many other people who seemingly “have-it-all” say, the success ruined everything. It makes you think “the pursuit of happiness” or the journey is the sweet part or when psychologists say: the journey in pursuit of a goal is much more satisfying than attaining the goal itself - they might just be onto something.


Let’s say one day, we figure out the Theory of Everything. Let’s say it’s simple, elegant and beautiful just like we always imagined it to be. We see with our own eyes everything we hoped to see. But where do you go from there?


These are simple wonderments that have been so overlooked in the overarching, all-encompassing, huge institutional machines that religions become. They turn into a way of asserting one’s power rather than what they were born out of. Because that’s what all religions are, they’re born out of these philosophical and important, close-to-heart questions. But end up becoming something else, in a dimension of its own.


Toward the end of the Enlightenment era, up until the early 1900s, we really did believe that would be the end of religion. The death of it. We overlooked the most basic human cravings in making such assumptions. 


It’s crazy how we humans as a collective think about the future of humanity while simply stepping over the needs of many individuals altogether.
