The Beginning -

Letâ€™s first begin with Ezekiel. Ezekiel was a prophet who can be seen as responsible for a new kind of ideology within the Israelites.


He blamed the exile of the Israelites to Babylon on their sins. He said that the Israelites had been turning into the other nations. They were supposed to be better. Not let their God and religion be used like a trophy to show off to others. Not use their God or religion to get rich and powerful.


When Ezekiel blamed their sins for the exile, the people believed that they were rewarded for their faithfulness to God and punished for their unfaithfulness. And since they as a people went through so many tough times, they figured they had to show their utmost level of faith toward God. 
So when the sweet release of freedom finally came back their way, they went all out. Not only did they rebuild their temples, they no longer appointed a King. With this change, the High Priest became the person with the utmost power as they transitioned into a theocracy.
