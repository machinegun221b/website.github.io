Despite his life of privilege, being brought up in the royal household, Moses was well-aware he was an Israelite. And that’s where his loyalties lied. To know more about what was happening to “his” people, Moses went to watch them work. Upon seeing an Egyptian boss beatin an Israelite up, Moses’ rage grew so high that he killed the guy and buried him in the sand. 


The next day he want back to watch the Israelites at work. But this time he watched two Israelites fighting amongst themselves. When Moses tried to interfere, the guy who’d started the fight derided him. Asking him if he’d kill him and bury him in the sand like he did the Egyptian, the day before.


Moses realized he wasn’t safe anymore, now that the word had gotten out it would soon reach the palace and put him in jeopardy. So he fled to the deserts and found a place to stay with a shepherd’s family. And in that desert, originates the famous story of Moses and the Burning bush.
