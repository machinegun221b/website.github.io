I love the way Richard Holloway explains prophecy. He goes on to compare the existence of a “beyond time-space as we see it” with our own consciousness having more to it than we truly realise. So if you’re interested in truly trying to understand religion and/or how so many people might have come to follow it, I definitely recommend reading “The Doors” chapter of his book, “A little history of Religion.”
But I believe, an open mind is the most crucial thing on this expedition. 


(If you’d like for me to write about this, please do let me know.)




Prophecy seems to be the backbone of many religions. Stories told by prophets have been carried forward for millennia. First through word of mouth and then through written texts. To this day, these texts are studied by devout believers. 


It is said that a book that has stood the test of time are treasures that need to be celebrated. That they have something special about them that’s allowed them to stand the test of time. To be honest, this is what drew me toward religion, to begin with. The lure of these texts that have been around for thousands of years and have been translated into innumerable languages. They, to this day, are cherished and celebrated and have gained such a following that such huge institutions have formed around them. So what then are the ideas behind each of these texts that may be the cause for all this?


Let us take a closer look at each of these.
