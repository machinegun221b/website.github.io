The tradition of children asking questions about the Passover of the eve of the Feast has been followed for over 3300 years now. The same answers to the same questions, over and over again. "They are free now. So they too, can recline."

This has been one of the tragedies of the history of humanity. For so many times the children asked these questions to hear the answers that echoed their freedom, the Jewish people were back in captivity.

Celebrating this act of liberation and making it their defining moment, the Jewish people who have undergone numerous acts of persecution, have found a way to reflect on their past to find hope for the future.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-   A characteristic trait of religion at large.
