I wanted to write about something else today. But I’m not sure what. I wanna start a podcast, and have been working on it for a while now. Made a lot of progress in like, 10 days but then hit a topic that’s really been stalling me now. I’m always working on a few other things, which I hope will all reach completion. My God that sounds weird as a “grown-up”. Speaking of which that was a great movie, that first one I mean. The secon one, meh.

Anyway, it’s tough taking care of living things. Hadn’t realised that until recently. I was taking care of a few plants, a few fish and also for a very short period of time, a dog. It felt like it was all so fucking easy until a bunch of the plants started to die. My God, are they the most difficult to care for of these above mentioned creatures.

I feel like I’m boring myself talking about all of this now.

Let’s switch lanes. Friendship? Family? Work? Or the so-called “work-life” balance ideology that has been corrupting the modern world? I like that one, let’s go with that.

**CUT TO “WORK-LIFE BALANCE”:**  
Some people love work, they love TO work, and they love the people they work with, the environment they work in and are super proud of the work they do. Meanwhile, they might have a perfectly happy and fulfilled family they go home to every night. Or they may not. Or they might still be working on all of their relationships and trying to achieve that perfection they’ve imagined in their heads thanks to the poisonous seed of the mythical “work-life” balance planted in there by society.

There may be others, who hate work because of low job satisfaction or horrible work-environments or are embarrassed of the work they do but love the very fact that they even get to work in the first place.

Furthermore, there’s some who may have low energy levels because of health issues, or difficulties in other places.

Whatever it is, it’s their own fucking business. These things that happen outside of the workplace that interfere with our ability to function and maintain the societally established paradigms for a happy and healthy life are never under our control. They’re not things that can be predicted or be “handled” or “controlled” by any of the regular training that we receive from an early age, such as schooling. We learn only to maneuver through work-related problems, etc. Clear boundaries in something as unified as a individuals life is literally laughable.

Society seems to think it has a say in everything we do. It permeates through the walls of the personal to the intimate. It has no bearing in so many of the unique situations we may each find ourselves in. And yet we let it dictate politics and the way so much of the important technical work that we do is done.

We have very lively debates these days about “political-correctness”. But much to our credit, none of seem to really know what the fuck that even really means. Much like many other issues such as feminism, the debates around these overshadow the very issues themselves, and bury them deep. Leaving millions baffled. So then, what do we do about these things? Because if we’re unable to get through to the common man on the basics such as the very meanings of these words or issues, what the hell are we doing?
