Working on your own stuff is incredibly hard. Not because of the amount of work involved. Not even because of the amount of decision-making involved. Man is decision-making draining AF. But it’s because you have to have a timeline and ensure you’re sticking to it. You have no one but yourself to be accountable for.


Yes, with all of that comes flexibility and freedom, but sometimes we really undervalue the rigidity and rules that we are able to have in life. 


I mean imagine the ancient people and their cultures. They had the time and energy to do so much more than us and they weren’t constantly bombarded with information and questions that made everything fickle. Not like it does today.
