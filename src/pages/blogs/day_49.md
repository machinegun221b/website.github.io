Little known fact and completely unbeknownst to me, Hinduism did not come from people who originally lived in the Indian subcontinent. Yes, Hinduism in the form we know it today is believed to have originated in the Indus Valley region but, before Hinduism came along the people of the Indus Valley civilization had their own set of beliefs and systems in place. The beliefs and ideologies that they had may not be termed religion, but they did have their own Gods whom they worshipped, and they were polytheistic. 


So where the hell did Hinduism come from? Well from the same people who brought us the language Samskrutham. This is a fact that kind of cleared up some things for me. I donâ€™t about you, but I have come across some terms that originated from other ancient languages in other parts of the world and I was amazed by how similar the words sounded to something of a similar meaning that we had over here.


So who were these people who came along and established a new religion, brought in a new language that swept across the whole of the Indian subcontinent and has echoed throughout history and onto this day?




Endnote:
The Gods that the Indus Valley people worshipped do last to this day, and their temples can still be found most famously in Nepal today. The fact that these Gods and the rituals surrounding them did not vanish may speak to some extent to the ideologies that Hinduism espouses, but more on that later. Maybe when we get to Sikhism.
