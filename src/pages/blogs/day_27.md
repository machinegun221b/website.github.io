From structures that seem so simplistic such as the dolmens (for example, Stonehenge) to incredibly complicated structures like the pyramids, the rituals surrounding death also became a lot more complex. In time, we see that the rituals also got a LOT more cruel. With acts like shoving the wives and servants into the burning fire that engulfed their husbands or masters.

Of course, for this to happen these people truly must have believed in the existence of life in the beyond. A continuance of this life, elsewhere. “Only the physical bodies, died.” Right? The sacrifice of these people who were yet alive was to ensure that their husband's or masters’ comfort would be continued to serve on the other side.

It seems like back then, unlike we do now, required no real proof or evidence. There was never any application of such a thing as the scientific method. What was widely assumed to be, was taken at that value. It was accepted. And those who questioned it would pay a price. Despite having nothing to prove any of the assumptions to be true, the belief that was held in each of these was so primal and intimate that questioning it would not be tolerated.

It was such a high level of faith, it was never even thought of as faith. It was nothing other than the absolute truth. Despite it all being of humans.

And that is a perfect segue to Prophecy I suppose?
