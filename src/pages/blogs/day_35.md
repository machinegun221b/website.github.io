The Hindu Religion seems to be the oldest known religion. Were there others before it? That seems to be up for debate. But it is the oldest religion for which we have found evidence and can be traced back to being over 5000 years old. The main reason for this is the fact that the advent of writing helped solidify its apparent age in history books.


Whatever may or may not have existed before this, what we do know for sure is that the Hindu religion is the oldest religion that remains to this day.


So let’s see what ideas it espouses.
In Hinduism, also known as “Sanathana Dharma”, the central idea seems to be the concept of Karma. Karma is the consequence of one’s actions. Whatever you do, it carries a consequence which will be the determining factor of how your future looks.


But there’s another idea in Hinduism that Karma is tied up with. That this the idea of having one, single soul for eternity. Your is what your identity is and through space-time, it shall travel for multiple lifetimes. And it isn’t necessary that throughout this cycle, you only live as a human. You may take on various forms.


And over these lifetimes, your actions will determine your karma. And if your net karma is bad, you will pay for those actions in the next life. If your net karma is good, your next life will be better. This cycle may repeat millions of times for one soul. But none of this is to be viewed as punishment or reward. It is to be viewed as a law of nature, and just that. 


The finality of this was only Moksha. Moksha is something that is to be seen as the one true purpose. Moksha is what will be the sweet release from existence itself. Not just life. 


In Hinduism, there was no concept of a beyond. You just disappeared into the vastness. Moksha was the finish line that every soul aspired to reach.




These are basic all-encompassing ideas.


While reincarnation isn’t unique to Hinduism, the intensity with which the idea is accepted can only be seen in Indian Religion.
So then, what are some other religions that seem to take this route?
