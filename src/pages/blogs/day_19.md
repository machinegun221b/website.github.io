So it’s been over 3 weeks since I wrote. Have I been busy? Well to be honest yes. But I could’ve written something and posted it. And yet, I didn’t.

The first day, I seriously forgot. I didn’t realise until the clock had struck 12 that I hadn’t written anything the previous day. But after that, I went on a trip, got busy with other work and eventually just made myself forget maybe.

Nonetheless, I’m back now. And this time we’re gonna do things differently. I’m not gonna start from day 1. That would not be smart. Instead, I’m gonna continue with the numbers as they were. This will be day 19. But I will attempt to write to 119 this time. Let’s hope this works, at least this time around.

This is trial run 2 of the 100 days “challenge” and we’re starting again, at Day 19.
